**Business Objective:**  At our Maersk APMT Terminal there are several engineers that are deployed on site for the maintenance of the site and ships which sometimes require them to get the spare parts form the inventory. Now we are providing a solution where the user will be providing an image of the needed spare part and the Machine Learning model running at the backend would be providing the user with the images of the spare part that are similar to the required one for the identification and inventory information.
